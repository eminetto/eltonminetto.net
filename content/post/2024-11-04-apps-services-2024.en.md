This post is part of a tradition I started 10 years ago! Every now and then, I make a list of the apps and services I use on a daily basis and share them in these posts. Discovering new apps is something I love, so I can help someone who has the same taste for new things.

Interestingly, some apps I've been using since 2014, like [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) (which I'm using to write this post) and [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/). I'll talk about both of them in a moment, but first, I want to talk about another tool that's crucial to my setup: SetApp (horrible pun, but I couldn't resist).

I've been using [Setapp](https://setapp.sjv.io/6egdeq?sharedid=aps) since 2017 and am still a huge fan. Its monthly subscription gives you access to over 250 apps, some for macOS and some for iOS and iPadOS.

PS: if you sign up through the [link](https://setapp.sjv.io/6egdeq?sharedid=aps), you and I will receive some benefits (which may change depending on the subscription date).

PS2: Since I use several Setapp apps, I'll mark them in *italics* for easy identification.

Without further ado, let's get to my list, separated into some categories, as I did in the [last post](https://eltonminetto.dev/post/2022-07-31-aplicativos-indispensaveis-2022/) (in portuguese) in this series.


## Software development

- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com) + [fish](https://fishshell.com/). I wrote a [post](https://eltonminetto.dev/en/post/2023-05-16-improving-terminal/) explaining my environment settings.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). No introduction is needed, right? I use it mainly for development in Go.
- [Zed](https://zed.dev) is my second editor. I use it as much as I can because it's a very lightweight and well-built tool. VSCode wins when I need to debug in Go because it's better prepared for that.
- [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) is a fast and free Docker Desktop replacement for personal use. It comes with a configured K8s cluster, which is useful for local testing.
- [OpenLens](https://github.com/MuhammedKalkan/OpenLens). Although I like using kubectl to manage the local k8s cluster, OpenLens is helpful, especially when I want to show something in a lecture because it is more visual.


## Productivity

- [1Password](https://1password.com). Password and secret vault. It's a subscription I'd pay for without thinking twice.
- *[CleanMyMac](https://setapp.com/pt-br/apps/cleanmymac). Cleans up macOS and optimizes several performance settings.*
- *[Paste](https://setapp.com/pt-br/apps/paste). This very useful clipboard manager app was a recent addition to my list.*
- *[Soulver](https://setapp.com/pt-br/apps/soulver). Note-taking tool that automatically performs calculations based on the text. Very useful for quick calculations.*
- *[Lungo](https://setapp.com/pt-br/apps/lungo). For those times when I don't want macOS to go into sleep mode.*
- *[Spark](https://setapp.com/pt-br/apps/spark-mail). Email client with superb usability and some handy features. I'm curious to try [Notion Mail](https://www.notion.so/product/mail), and maybe Spark is in danger of being dropped from my list by 2025*
- *[Bartender](https://setapp.com/pt-br/apps/bartender). Helps organize the clutter of icons in your macOS menu bar.*
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so). My second brain, I write everything down in it.
- [Notion Calendar](https://www.notion.so/product/calendar). I've been using it since Notion bought the company when it was called Cron.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/pt-BR). I adopted it this year after using paper notebooks for years and Apple's Reminders for a while. It's a great tool and well worth the subscription.
- **Google Workspace**. I pay for the plan for one user with my own domain. With this, I have an email and access to Drive, Docs, and other tools.
- **Safari** is my main browser, but I still have Google Chrome for some emergencies, like using Google Meet, which is faster in Google's browser.
- **Freeform**. I use this native Apple app to take notes on iPad and MacOS.
- [Readwise](https://readwise.io). I recently subscribed to it to centralize the notes I take in e-books and blog posts. It's still too early to know if I'll renew the subscription in 2025.

## Posts and Lectures

- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). I've been a fan of the product and company for over 10 years. It's my favorite Markdown editor.
- [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/). This is another tool I've been using for a decade to schedule social media posts.
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) is another tool that I happily renew every year. I use it to help me proofread my [English posts](https://eltonminetto.dev/en/).
- **Google Slides**. I have used the excellent [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com) for years, but recently, I started using Google Slides to produce slides for my presentations. The advantage is that it is easy to share presentations, but I still miss the practicality of Deckset. Maybe I will rethink this decision at some point. 
- For this site, I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and I host the markdown files on GitHub. Publishing is done whenever I push to the repository using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
- To manage the newsletters [A Semana Go](https://asemanago.dev) and [Mais que Senior](https://maisquesenior.dev), I use [Substack](http://substack.com/home).

Of course, I always have **Apple Music** open while I work because I can't live without music. Another must-have category is communication apps like **WhatsApp** and **Telegram**, which are always open to chatting with friends and family.

You may have noticed the absence of AI tools like **ChatGPT**, right? Although I installed the tool, it has yet to become part of my daily usage flow. However, the vast majority of tools I use have AI features, so I can say that I use technology in the best way I can imagine: without even realizing it.

If you have any suggestions, you can share them here in the comments.
If you find it useful for me to make a similar list of the apps I use on the iPad, use the comments to give me this feedback.
