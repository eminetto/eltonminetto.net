Lendo meus resumos RSS encontrei esse pequeno texto que achei muito inspirador:
"Apple started in a garage. Dell started in a dorm room. Starbucks
started with a single store. Nike started out of a car trunk. Crate &
Barrel started with a single store without budget for displays so they
used shipping crates and barrels to display their products. Anthony
Maglica started making Mag Lights in his garage. Google started as a
thesis. eBay and Amazon share similar stories. Great companies need to
grow into great companies. They need room to make mistakes. They need
room to go unnoticed for a while. They're just like people. Be
ambitious, but grow into it."
