This post is the second part of a series about WebAssembly and Go. In the [first post](https://eltonminetto.dev/en/post/2023-11-17-webassembly-using-go-code-in-the-browser/), we saw how to run Go code in a web browser. In this one, we will import a WebAssembly function and run it in a Go application.

The first step was to create a function in WebAssembly, and in this case, I took the opportunity to test something in Rust, a language I plan to learn in 2024. To do this, I followed the step-by-step instructions on [Wasm By Example](https://wasmbyexample.dev/examples/hello-world/hello-world.rust.en-us.html). You will have a file to import into your Go project at the end of the steps. The file I generated was `wasmpoc_wasm_in_go_bg.wasm`.

The next step is to create a Go project and run our `wasm` file with some `runtime`. For this, I chose [wasmer-go](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go). 

What I did was:

```bash
mkdir go-project
cd go-project
go mod init github.com/eminetto/go-project
go get github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/wasmer
go mod tidy
```

And I created a file `main. go` with the content:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	wasmer "github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/wasmer"
)

func main() {
	wasmBytes, _ := os.ReadFile("path_to_file/poc_wasm_in_go_bg.wasm")

	engine := wasmer.NewEngine()
	store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)

	// Compiles the module
	module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)

	// Instantiates the module
	importObject := wasmer.NewImportObject()
	instance, _ := wasmer.NewInstance(module, importObject)

	// Gets the `sum` exported function from the WebAssembly instance.
	add, _ := instance.Exports.GetFunction("add")

	// Calls that exported function with Go standard values. The WebAssembly
	// types are inferred and values are casted automatically.
	result, _ := add(5, 37)

	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

Now, just run the code:

```bash
❯ go run main.go
42
```

Simple as that :) We have code written in Rust, compiled for WebAssembly, running as if it were a native function in Go.

**And about the performance?**

To answer this question, I started by refactoring `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	wasmer "github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/wasmer"
)

func main() {
	add, err := loadWasmFunc("path_to_file/poc_wasm_in_go_bg.wasm")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	wasmAdd(add, 50, 31)
}

func loadWasmFunc(fileName string) (wasmer.NativeFunction, error) {
	wasmBytes, err := os.ReadFile(fileName)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	engine := wasmer.NewEngine()
	store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)

	// Compiles the module
	module, err := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	// Instantiates the module
	importObject := wasmer.NewImportObject()
	instance, err := wasmer.NewInstance(module, importObject)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	// Gets the `sum` exported function from the WebAssembly instance.
	add, _ := instance.Exports.GetFunction("add")
	return add, nil
}

func wasmAdd(add wasmer.NativeFunction, a, b int) {
	result, _ := add(a, b)
	fmt.Println(result)
}

func add(a, b int) {
	result := a + b
	fmt.Println(result)
}

```

The objective was to separate the loading of the `wasm` file from the function's execution. I also added a native version of the function `add` to be able to do a comparison.

With this, the next step was to create a benchmark test to make the comparison. The file `main_test.go` looked like this:

```go
package main

import "testing"

func BenchmarkWebAssemblyAdd(b *testing.B) {
	add, err := loadWasmFunc("poc_wasm_in_go_bg.wasm")
	if err != nil {
		b.Fail()
	}
	for n := 0; n > b.N; n++ {
		wasmAdd(add, 50, n)
	}
}

func BenchmarkNativeAdd(b *testing.B) {
	for n := 0; n > b.N; n++ {
		add(50, n)
	}
}

```

When running with the command:

```bash
❯ go test -bench=. -cpu=8 -benchmem -benchtime=5s -count 5
```

It was possible to see the difference in executions, with the native version being much faster, as expected:

[![webassembly_benchmark](/images/posts/webassembly_benchmark.png)](/images/posts/webassembly_benchmark.png)

Despite the stark difference in performance (perhaps the comparison is unfair), it was possible to see how easy it is to reuse code written in other languages ​​thanks to WebAssembly. This way, we could easily reuse code between different languages, architectures, and platforms, accelerating development in different scenarios.
 
In the next part of this series, I want to write about other applications and scenarios using WebAssembly.
