## Full Stack developer

In the last years, the term full stack developer grown in many job opportunities, mainly in startups. According to this post, a full stack developer is:

<!--more-->

>> […] an engineer who can handle all the work of databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients. Depending on the project, what customers need may be a mobile stack, a Web stack, or a native application stack.

And the post, that is awesome, add a list of things that a person should learn to become a full stack developer: programming languages, databases, cache, design, UX, and so on.

If this can overwhelm to someone that is a developer for some years it is frightening for a newbie. I have an opinion about it, but before let see what is a full cycle developer.

## Full Cycle Developer

This name first appears [in a post](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249) from Netflix’s technology blog, in 2018.

In this post the author explains the problems they were facing and how they achieve a model:

>> […] we arrived at a model where a development team, equipped with amazing developer productivity tools, is responsible for the full software life cycle: design, development, test, deploy, operate, and support.

Ok, ok, probably you don’t have the same performance, scalability or complexity problems that Netflix had. But if you replace *development team* for *developer* we can reach the point that made me write this post.

Instead of learning superficially all technologies related to developing a software (backend, frontend, databases, UX, etc), is more important a developer that can manage a task, from design to deploy and support.

That is basically the scenario I’ve been working with in the last years. In this time I worked with specialists in their fields that was able to, thanks to their knowledge and tools, to manage all the development cycle cited in Netflix’s post.

I believe this is a is a healthier way to evolve in a software development career. That way, one can become a more responsible and complete professional, able to be a specialist and work well in teams, along with other experts. That is what more and more companies will look in the years to come.
