I started using AWS tools in mid-2008 when a local cloud provider left the startup where I was CTO (the late Drimio) down for more than 24 hours. Since then, AWS has always been my first choice as a cloud solutions provider.

It was my recommendation to host the servers of [Coderockr](http://coderockr.com) customers. After that, at [Codenation](https://codenation.dev), we made heavy use of EC2, S3, RDS, CloudFront, Route53, and [lambda functions](https://www.slideshare.net/eminetto/serverless-em-go). And at [Trybe](https://betrybe.com), we just migrated our infrastructure from Heroku to [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). 


So when I found out about the AWS Community Builders program, I rushed to apply! And after a few weeks, I received the good news:

But what is AWS Community Builders? According to the [site](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/):

> The AWS Community Builders program offers technical resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities to AWS enthusiasts and emerging thought leaders who are passionate about sharing knowledge and connecting with the technical community.

For me, it's a form of recognition and encouragement to continue publishing posts, presenting lectures, and sharing code. I hope I can make good use of the opportunity and continue growing and collaborating with the community.
