I'm a software developer.

No matter what I'm doing (and I did a lot of different things in the past years, like create startups, speech in events, and became a father), I always will do this with a software developer's mindset: analyzing the task carefully, breaking a big problem in smaller ones, looking for ways to optimize the result, and so on.

I believe that software development is a form of art, like a piece of good music (a heavy metal one, if I can choose ü§ò), and I'm always aiming to improve my skills.

I spent the last years studying and applying new software architectures, adding programming languages to my personal toolbox, deploying to cloud environments, leading agile teams, writing posts, and speaking in many events.
