I'm a software developer.

No matter what I'm doing (and I did a lot of different things in the past years, like creating startups, speeches at events, and becoming a father), I always will do this with a software developer's mindset: analyzing the task carefully, breaking a big problem in smaller ones, looking for ways to optimize the result, and so on.

I believe software development is a form of art, like a piece of good music (a heavy metal one, if I can choose ü§ò), and I always aim to improve my skills.

I spent the last years studying and applying new software architectures, adding programming languages to my toolbox, deploying to cloud environments, leading agile teams, writing posts, and speaking at many events.
