                  <p>
                     This template is an advanced HTML5 template powered by some modern features such as CSS3, LESS and AJAX to render the styles, colors, fonts and some additional visual enhancements. LESS and AJAX will work only from server side, means  <strong>you have to upload all files to a real web hosting server in order to view proper colours and fonts rendering of this template.</strong> If you just test them from your local computer you will not be able to see proper colours or fonts, but this is not at all any errors. Please upload the template to a web server and edit it there. 
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="highlight">1. Why this documentation is very important?</h3>
                  <p> We are sure that we have covered all the essential instructions needed to setup a nice website as you see in our template’s live preview. We expect you to read this user guide before you open any support request (if you ask about things already present in this guide, you will be gently asked to read this again</p>
                  <h3 class="highlight">2. If I need help, will you provide free support?</h3>
					<p> <strong>Yes,</strong> we have a dedicated <a href="https://goo.gl/iTD6Fr">support system</a>  where we offer free support even though providing support is not mandatory for themeforest authors. Our support is applicable only for issues and bugs within our product live previews (nonedited version of the template). We do NOT provide free customisation services in the scope of free support.  
					</p>
                  <h3 class="highlight">3.  What kind of support are you providing?</h3>
					<p>We offer free support for our products where we can help you ﬁx issues within our code (if any) and assist you on template setup (in some cases if the task is minimal).  Please note support is not applicable for third party jQuery plugins and GPL code components (because they are not created or maintained by us). Also support is not applicable to issues or bugs happening on your edited version of the template. We are not offering any debugging service on your edited websites.

					</p>
                  <h3 class="highlight">4. When can I expect a response from you?</h3>
					<p>Our team will be online during 08.30 to 17.30 on Monday – Friday (GMT + 6.00, Dhaka). For support request we usually make a response within 24 to 48 hours.

                  <h1>Main File Structure</h1>
                  <p>
                     All the file are well organized, its so easy to work with the template.
                     <br> 1. Unzip the themeforest package zip file.
                     <br> 2. Open "HTML" folder.
                     <br> 3. You will find the the template directories there.
                     <br>
                     <br>All templates file on the root that will be edited as your need.
                     <br> Also you will see few directories like, CSS, js, fonts, images/img etc.
                     <br> CSS folder contains only the Essential stylesheet, img/images folder contain all images of your project, JS folder contain only the jquery library & Fonts folder contain essetial font files for fonts and scss folder contain your essential
                     scss file.
                  </p>
				  
				  <p>Once you download the ZIP ﬁle from themeforest and you extract them to a folder, you will ﬁnd a directory with a name such as ‘site’. This will be the root directory containing your web template and associated ﬁles & resources. The contents of this directory may look like this:

                  <h1>  Basic Steps for Building Your Website  </h1>
                   
            <p>In order to make your website functional with this template you have to edit the web pages, add your own content and media, upload all these ﬁles to a web server
</p>
<h3 class="highlight">Step 1: Editing template web pages </h3>
<p>The template consists of HTML5 ﬁles that can form a collection of web pages linked in between which is called as a Site. The site is initially loaded from a main web page (index.html) and linked to other pages or sections</p>
<p>In order to edit a web page you have to use any standard code editor where you should be familiar of editing general HTML5 markup. We recommend SublimeText http:// www.sublimetext.com/ as the best code editor as it is the ﬁrst choice among our developers. </p>
<p>Once you opened the editor, you can view and edit HTML5 ﬁles, for example the root HTML5 ﬁle: "ROOT]/INDEX.HTML " </p>
<p>You can now add / remove contents by modifying the markup inside this HTML5 document (this is completely explained from chapter 4 onwards). Please note, you have to keep the home page of your site renamed as INDEX.HTML even if it may be named differently in the template directory structure</p>
      <h3 class="highlight">Step 2: Editing template style (look and feel) </h3>
	  <p>The template consists of CSS ﬁles along with the associated resources such images linked within. You can use the same code editor for editing the CSS rules. Don’t worry, if you are not planning to change the look and feel of this template you don’t have to edit any CSS. But in other case, you must be familiar of advanced CSS rules in order to modify this template’s look and feel. Similarly, you have to know JS in order to control the interactions deﬁned in this template (JS knowledge is not needed for basic users to edit the site content).
</p>
<h3 class="highlight">Step 3: Finalising the website </h3>
<p>Once everything is edited and content is added you may combine multiple CSS ﬁles as well as multiple JS ﬁles to separate ﬁles. This will increase overall loading response of the website. You can get more info about this online</p>


<h3 class="highlight">Step 4: Publishing the website online. </h3>
<p>The ﬁnal step is to upload all ﬁles to web server (we mean all ﬁles as explained in previous chapter). The server is actually a web-hosting provider, which can store your ﬁles, and anyone can access the site across the globe <br />If you don’t have a web server space, it is time to get one. That means you need a working web hosting account to be purchased from any of the hosting providers. If you don’t have it yet, we recommend the professional web hosting from <strong><a href="https://goo.gl/oLNw4e">Bluehost</a></strong>.   </p>

               <div id="five" class="content fade">
                  <h1> Bootstrap 4 Framework</h1>
            <p>Get started with Bootstrap, the world's most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with the Bootstrap CDN and a template starter page.</p>
			
			<h3>Bootstrap’s grid system</h3>
			<img src="img/bootstrap.jpg" alt="Bootstrap 3" />
			<p>Use our powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.
</p>
<h3>Grid Options</h3>
<img src="img/grid.png" alt="" />
<p>We are having page limitation to explain everything about Bootstrap here. So for more information we refer to original documentation for Bootstrap, found here: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">http://getbootstrap.com/</a>
</p>
               </div>
               <div id="six" class="content fade">
                  <h1> Replacing Placeholder Images </h1>
                   
				   <p>Once you download the template from themeforest you may notice that Live preview images (as you see in our demo) is not included in the pack. This is because live preview images are properties of their owners and photographers, we are unable to redistribute them. We have provided placeholder images instead of such stock images, we have generated placeholders via an online service: http://lab.csschopper.com/placeholder/ </p>
				   <img src="img/800x400.png" alt="" />
				   <p>Now, you have to make your own image with a dimension as: <br />WIDTH = 800 <br /> Height = 400px  <br />Format = JPG.  <br />and replace the URL as your own image. <br /> For example: <pre><xmp><img src= “ your_image_here.jpg ” /></xmp></pre></p>
				   
				   <p>Like this you can simply replace any placholder image with your own images with similar dimensions and ﬁle format. Also keep them in the same directory structure if speciﬁed in the markup or CSS rules for such images.
</p>
<p><small>But in some cases the images will be supplied by JS ﬁles, for example in Fullscreen BG Slideshows. So please read the documentation information related to each module to locate the actual images supplied via their code.</small>
